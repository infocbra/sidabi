## Project SIDABI 
The SIDABI project is a web-based software following the concept of data integration for the health area and with a focus on Parkinson's disease. The system has several features to assist in the monitoring and follow-up of exams and clinical assessments of symptoms of people with the disease. Also, the system contributes to the research area, data storage in an organized manner avoiding fragmentation and data loss. The data can also be shared internally among users through research groups created to facilitate and speed up the exchange of results between researchers working in the same line. Beyond that, the system has a module that helps in theoretical and practical learning, through videos and tutorials, about the disease. The project has an area for the system administrator, who can insert and configure users to access specific modules and screens, in different levels of data manipulation. The project has several other features to contribute to the management and analysis of information from people with Parkinson's disease, aiming to improve the conditions of daily living of these individuals.

* [ChartJs](https://www.chartjs.org/) - An open-source project for simple yet flexible JavaScript charting for designers & developers
* [BootboxJS](http://bootboxjs.com/) - A small JavaScript library which allows you to create programmatic dialog boxes using Bootstrap modals.
* [PHP Template](https://github.com/raelgc/template) - It was built by Rael and it helps to separate HTML, CSS, JS from programming logic layer.
* [inlineSearch]() - Component was built by Carlos Melo (carlos.melorodovalho@gmail.com) aiming facilitate the search for information via input text.

### Installing
The project needs to be installed in a web server, e.g. [Apache Web Server](https://httpd.apache.org/), with [PHP 5.6+](https://www.php.net/) language as a server-side engine.
In addition, a database server runining [PostgreSQL 9.5+](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
